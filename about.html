            <p>
              I recently graduated from Michigan State University with a bachelor's in Advertising Management. Before that, I interned at MSU's Office of Faculty and Academic Staff Affairs, where I led user research, conducted UX audits, and helped select product tools that improved internal workflows. The summer before that, I spent a summer with Southwestern Advantage generating $42K in revenue across 794 product demos, which taught me more about understanding people and what they actually need than I ever expected.
            </p>

            <p>
              On top of that, I spent a semester as the strategic lead on a capstone project for COG, an AI-powered platform helping Gen Z job seekers navigate an increasingly complicated job market. That project lit something up for me; researching competitors, shaping positioning, and seeing ideas turn into something a real founder could actually use was fulfilling.
            </p>

            <p>
              Currently, I'm working on an app called <a href="portfolio/addie/"><em>addie</em></a>, designed to help people experiencing anxiety and panic attacks in real time. In my free time, I'm usually working out, spending time with family, or gaming. I'm interested in user-centric roles that incorporate AI in meaningful ways.

            <p>P.S. This whole site was vibe-coded :)</p>
